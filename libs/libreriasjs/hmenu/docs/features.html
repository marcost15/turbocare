            DynarchMenu is developed in Mozilla FireFox and tested with
            Internet Explorer for Windows (versions 5.0, 5.5, 6.0), Opera
            7.x for both Windows and Linux, Konqueror for Linux.  The menu
            is known to work with Apple Safari too, as well as with any
            Gecko-based browser such as Netscape 7.x, Galeon, Camino and
            of course, Mozilla, most probably any version.

        <div class="details">
          <p>
            DynarchMenu provides outstanding keyboard navigation features.
            Currently, keyboard support is fully functional with Internet
            Explorer (all versions) and any Gecko-based browser (Mozilla,
            FireFox, Netscape 7+, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a slight limitation in Internet Explorer (any
            version): our menu can not completely override keys that open
            the browser menus (such as ALT-F).  If your DynarchMenu
            installation has menus that should open at ALT-F, then they
            will work in IE, but the browser's menu will also open.  We
            have found no workaround for this browser problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keyboard shortcuts are extremely easy to specify: just
            prefix the letter which you want to be the shortcut with
            an underscore character (“_”).  The menu will understand
            that that letter is the shortcut and will take care to
            underline it and to include it in the menu's keymap.
            Additionally, underlined keys from the toplevel menu bar
            will respond to ALT-key shortcut which will open the
            submenu associated for that item (or trigger other action).

          <p>
            The menu is generated from pure HTML code.  That is, you don't
            have to mess with JavaScript code and internals.  You simply
            write your menu as an HTML list (which may contain nested
            lists&mdash;those are submenus) and only have to call
            <em>one</em> JavaScript function, upon the &lt;body&gt;

          </p>

            <li>
              <strong>Does not require JS knowledge</strong>.  You can “draw” a menu

          <p>
            Our menu contains code to protect against the “z-index”
            bug of windowed controls in Internet Explorer.  A windowed
            control is for instance a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>
            element, or a &lt;textarea&gt;.  Other examples are
            ActiveX objects, Java applets or Flash animations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bug is simple: no element can be layered on top of a
            windowed control in Internet Explorer.  The windowed
            control normally appears on top of “unprotected” elements,
            no matter what “z-index” setting may they have in CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dynarch.com implemented code to protect against this IE
            bug, using an idea emitted by Joe King.

          <p>
            DynarchMenu can be displayed across frames.  That is, you
            can show the main menu in one frame, and make the popups
            appear in another frame.  This is probably the easiest and
            most portable way to make the menu stay fixed in page, and
            it's a rare feature in DHTML menus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Support for this has been added in version 2.8 and it is

        <div class="details">
          <p>
            Using our menu you can easily setup context menus for the
            whole document object, or for certain specified elements;
            you can even have different context menus for different
            elements&mdash;after all, that's what the word “context”
            is all about, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is done extremely easy: just specify the ID of the
            element which you would like to assign a context menu to
            in a special class attribute at the &lt;LI&gt; tag that
            surrounds the menu.  More information is available in our
            <a href="examples/context.html" target="_blank"

            menus sample</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is an alternate way.  You can provide a menu that is
            also a part of the horizontal menu bar.  You don't even
            need to write it twice. :-) If you have a supported
            browser and you right-click in this page, you will see the
            same popup that appears in the “Preferences” menu (and
            notice that “Preferences” gets hovered while you're in the

            assuming the end-user has configured the browser to pass

          <p>
            As stated already, the menu is described through nested

          <p>
            Popup menus can (optionally and “on” by default) have shadows.
            Most Web-based menus provide it, but what it's unique to our
            menu are the <em>smooth</em>&mdash;blured, semi-transparent

            This makes high quality graphics that you usually find only in

            <strong>Note:</strong> this feature is not available in Internet
            Explorer 5.0 for Windows&mdash;it will show plain opaque

          » <strong>Timeouts</strong>: relaxed navigation
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>
            DynarchMenu allows one to set customizable timeouts for
            popups.  That is, the popup will not appear instantly when
            you hover an item that has a submenu, but rather after a
            timeout.  Also, the popups will not close immediately
            after the mouse hovers another element or leaves them, but
            after the same timeout.
          </p>
          <p>
            The “timeout idea” has been used for years in all
            desktop-based menu systems, and newer even in Web menus.
            It's good because it provides the end-user a short time
            (“timeout”) to change his mind about a menu: if he
            accidentaly leaved the submenu and chosed another item, he
            can still turn back (during this timeout) and the submenu
            will be “reactivated” (that is, it won't close at all).
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, this behavior is totally customizable&mdash;if
            you want instant popups, then you can set the timeout to
            zero.

            Using an additional helper script (“PieNG.js”) you can use PNG
            icons and rest assured that they will work fine with Internet
            Explorer too (5.5+).  “PieNG.js” is included in our menu

            One more word about “PieNG.js”&mdash;it is a free script, also

            you can safely include PNG graphics all over your pages and we

            that don't understand JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            The help strings are displayed in the window status bar and,
            optionally, as a tooltip.  Tooltip activation can be done very
            easily by passing a certain parameter to the single JavaScript
            function that you need to call&mdash;DynarchMenu.setup.

        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>
            With a bit of external JavaScript coding, DynarchMenu can
            support check boxes and/or radio buttons.  See our preferences
            for a real example.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            <img src="img/radiochecks.png"
                 alt="Check boxes and radio buttons"
                 title="This is a picture" />
          </p>
          <p>
            The above picture shows our preferences menu.  The submenu
            on the left contains some “check boxes” (they are
            unrelated to each other), while the one on the right only
            contain “radio buttons” (only one can be selected at a
            time).  Of course, you can also mix them if appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have complete control on how the menu behaves when a
            check box or a radio button is clicked, or even on how the
            small image (be it check box <img align="middle"
            src="icons/checkbox-1.gif" alt="checkbox on" /> or radio
            button <img src="icons/radio-1.gif" alt="radio button on"
            align="middle" />) looks like.  You can even say when to
            close the submenu and when not.  For instance, we chosen
            to close the “<u>P</u>references” popup if a check box is
            clicked and the menu is in “electric” mode, and to leave
            it open in “normal” mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, changing of features that require a menu
            redraw&mdash;like “shadows” preference or the skin&mdash;
            will always close the popup (but this is also dictated by
            outside scripts).

        <div class="details">
          <p>
            OK, we know that any menu supports <em>enabled</em> items.
            They are normal menu items, after all.  But what about
            <em>disabled</em> items?
          </p>
          <p>
            DynarchMenu is the first Web-based menu system that we know of
            to support disabled items.  That is, one
            is&mdash;programatically&mdash;able to disable/enable items
            without even requesting a page reload.  Of course, menu items
            can be disabled initially and enabled after the page loads.
          </p>
          <p>
            The very menu in this page is using this feature in order to
            disable the menu item that points to the current documentation
            page.  Also, in the “<u>P</u>references” submenu you can see
            certain items that are only enabled if the feature that they
            are related to is checked (such as “Timeout”&mdash;enabled
            only if “Electric” mode is on).

          » Optional <strong>electric mode</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>
            All Web-based menu systems that we know of only work in what
            we call “electric” mode.  That is, submenus are opened on
            “mouseover” event (when the cursor is over an item), without
            waiting for a click.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our menu also can work like a desktop-based menu: in order to
            open a submenu one has to click on the item.  In order to
            close all menus, one has to click somewhere outside them in
            the document (or to press ESC).
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that this approach is the nicest and less confusing
            one, because there are far more people accustomed to this
            behavior than to the “electric” one.  However, by just passing
            one parameter to the setup function, our menu can work in
            “electric” mode too.  The timeout to close submenus is also
            configurable.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can dynamically enable/disable “electric” mode or set the
            timeout from our “<u>P</u>references” menu.  Check it out,
            it's cool. ;-)

            Of course&mdash;do we have to even say it? ;-)&mdash;our menu
            supports “skins”.  Skins are ordinary CSS files that define
            how the menu looks like.

            In the distribution ZIP you can find 7 fine tuned color
            schemes that resemble the look of well known menus such as the
            ones from Windows 98, 2000 and XP, Mozilla Modern colors and
            of course, Aqua theme from Apple Mac OS X.  See our
            “<u>P</u>references” menu.

          </p>
          <p>
            (we spent tens of hours for working on them and we are
            <em>positive</em> that you won't find better looking menus all
            over the Web).
          </p>
          <p>
            There also exists a “system” theme which will always use the
            colors of the system where the browser runs on, therefore
            making the difference between the application in browser and
            other desktop applications transparent.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to use a customized skin, it's very easy for you
            to write your own.  We made things simple&mdash;the most
            complex skin that we created so far, Aqua, only has 16 lines
            of CSS code.

            OK, you'll say, the documentation is part of any product and
            we agree.  But our documentation is more than just
            documentation.  It's a complex, advanced example on what you
            can do with our menu.  It's almost a site in
            itself&mdash;simple, indeed, but it shows a lot of techniques
            that you would probably like to know of, such as using
            IFRAME-s for loading and displaying files without a full page
            refresh, or dynamically changing stylesheets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The menu documentation is perhaps the best menu sample in
            itself.  Use it, read it, understand it and look through its
            sources, and you'll learn a lot more than you could do from a
            printed PDF file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, our product also contains simple, commented,
            step-by-step tutorials helpful for a proper understanding of
            how the menu is configured.  These can be found in the
            “<a href="examples/" target="_blank" title="Index of example files"
            >examples</a>” subdirectory from the ZIP file.

          » Is it <strong>perfect</strong>?
        </div>
        <div class="details">
          <p>
            <strong>Perfect?</strong> Certainly not.  First of all, perfection
            is unachievable: browsers contain mistakes that we can't
            workaround.  They are <em>evolving</em>, certainly in the
            right direction, but they (all of them) are far from being
            perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given this condition, our menu can't be perfect.  But we
            did our best, and we believe that it's the closest one to
            perfection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, the known problems are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keyboard support currently works only with Mozilla (and
              related browsers such as Netscape 7+, FireFox) and
              Internet Explorer.  Other browsers such as Opera, Safari
              or Konqueror don't allow us to intercept ALT+key events
              through JS.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strange misalignments in Konqueror (and most probably,
              in Safari too).  We found no explanation therefore no
              solution for perfect alignment like other browsers do.
              However, the menu is still very well functional in
              Konqueror/Safari, and hopefully in the near future the
              browser will be fixed (each new version in the last year
              was sensibly better than the previous ones).
            </li>
            <li>
              Text from menu items is selectable in Opera and IE 5.0.
              While other browsers can properly stop events (or
              provide alternate ways, such as the “unselectable”
              attribute for IE 5.5+), Opera 7.x and IE 5.0 will ignore
              this and will allow text to be selected.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We believe that none of the above problems make a show
            stopper for any Web application.  Also, we are positive
            that any Web-based menu will have the above limitations,
            as they are generated by browser problems.  If <em>we</em>
            can't workaround them, then most probably no one can.
