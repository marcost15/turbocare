      <h1>Deviations from Web standards</h1>

      <p>
        This menu is built upon Web standards.  It makes use of
        features guaranteed by Web standards, but certain workarounds
        were necessary for browsers that do not follow Web standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don't normally have to read this page, unless you are
        curious which workarounds and for what browsers were needed in
        order to make the menu work like it does.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following is the browser situation at the time of this
        writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Mozilla (+ any other Gecko-based browser) and Opera there
        is no deviation from known Web standards; true it is that in
        Opera there is this problem: text can't be unselectable;
        however, as there is no workaround, there is no deviation from
        Web standards.  Congratulations to Mozilla and Opera teams!
