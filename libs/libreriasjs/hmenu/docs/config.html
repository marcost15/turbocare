      <h1>Customization options</h1>

      <p>
        The function <tt>DynarchMenu.setup</tt>, called at
        <tt>body.onload</tt>, actually accepts the following form:
      </p>

      <pre>DynarchMenu.setup(element_id, config);</pre>

      <p>
        The <tt>config</tt> parameter is optional; if present, it must
        be a JavaScript object containing configuration info.
        Currently it accepts the following parameters:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>“<tt>electric</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>(boolean or number) which specifies wether the horizontal
          menu items will open the submenus at mouseover or on click.
          If “<tt>electric</tt>” is <tt>true</tt> or a number other
          than zero, then submenus will be opened at mouseover (thus,
          upon hover) and will automatically close at mouseout,
          otherwise all the above happens upon click.  <b>Default:
          <tt>false</tt></b>.</p>

          <p>If a non-zero number is specified, then it configures the
          submenu hide timeout, in milliseconds.  For instance if you
          specified “500” then submenus will close in 500 milliseconds
          after the mouse cursor leaves them.  If during this timeout
          the mouse returns in the submenu, then the hiding action
          will be canceled.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>timeout</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>(number) which specifies the timeout, in milliseconds,
          for opening/closing submenus.  The default is “150” and we
          think it's a sane value.  Don't make it too big nor too
          small, as it can get annoying.</p>

          <p>Basically this means that an item which has a submenu
          will open the submenu after this timeout has elapsed.  Also,
          after leaving an item having a submenu which is visible,
          that submenu will close after this timeout has elapsed; if,
          during this time, the cursor returns to the item or to it's
          submenu, then the submenu will be “reactivated” and its
          closing will be cancelled.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>vertical</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            (boolean) default: false.  If this parameter is specified
            as “true”, then the base menu will appear as a vertical
            menu, instead of the horizontal bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            This parameter also implies “electric: true”, unless
            otherwise specified by the calling script.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>context</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            (boolean) default: false.  When "context: true" is
            specified, the main menu bar will never appear, and all
            submenus defined within it can act as context menus for
            different elements.  More details in the <a
            href="examples/context.html">context menus sample</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that you can setup context menus even without passing
            this configuration option (but in this case the main menu
            bar will be visible, like in this very page).
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>className</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>If specified, the given string will be added to the menu's
          and submenus' CSS class attributes.  This is useful for
          customizing different color themes for different menus
          within the same page.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>tooltips</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>(boolean) specifies if the menu should display tooltips.
          <b>Default: false</b>.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>shadows</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>(array or null) default: [2, 2].  If “null” then the popup
          menus will not display shadows.  If an array is passed then
          it <em>must</em> have 2 elements, integers, and they signify
          the shadow displacement relative to the popup menu position
          (i.e. [4, 2] means “show shadows of width 4 and height 2
          pixels”).</p>
          <p>Of course, you can specify [0, 0] if you want no shadows.  But
          using this instead of <tt>null</tt> will add a slight performance
          penalty (it might not be noticeable at all, but we know that it
          will be there) so if you don't want shadows, better pass
          <tt>null</tt> here.</p>
          <p><b>Note:</b> as of version 2.5, the shadows parameter can
          be a 4 elements array, in which case they will have the
          following meaning:</p>
          <pre>[ dx, dy, dw, dh ]</pre>
          <ul>
            <li><tt>dx, dy</tt> -- have the same meaning as in the
            2-elements variant.</li>
            <li><tt>dw, dh</tt> -- are added to the shadow width,
            height, in order to form a shadow bigger than the
            popup.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Using the variant above you can specify negative values
            for dx, dy and get shadows closer to shadows in Mac OSX,
            i.e. bigger than the popups.  Example values:
          </p>
          <pre>[-2, -1, 6, 6]</pre>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>smoothShadows</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>(boolean) default: true, unless the browser is IE 5.0 in
          which case this will be false.  This parameter takes effect
          only if “shadows” are enabled, and if its value is true then
          the displayed shadows will be “smooth”, meaning, they will
          have smooth edges and corners, just like WinXP menus.  When
          false the default shadows are used (a simple background of
          dark color).</p>
          <p>
            Smooth shadows look better, but requires loading of a
            (small) image from server.  The image will normally be
            cached, so one should not worry about this.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>blink</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>(boolean) default: false.  If true is specified, menu
          items will blink for a short time when they're clicked,
          resembling menus found in NeXT interfaces.</p>
          <p><b>Note:</b> as of version 2.5, this parameter can also
          be specified as a number.  If 0, no blinking takes place.
          If a positive integer, items will blink that many times
          before the action is triggered.  We recommend 3 or 5 if
          blinking is desired.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>lazy</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>(boolean) default: false.  If “lazy” is passed true, the
          menu will use a technique called “lazy initialization” in
          order to display a long menu instantly.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>toolbar</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>(boolean) default: false.  If you pass “true” to this
          parameter, the menu will be assigned some special CSS bits
          that make it more suitable to <a href="examples/toolbar.html"
          title="Toolbar sample (opens new window)" target="_blank">create a toolbar.</a></p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>container</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>(HTMLElement) default: document.body.  You can specify
          here an element of your choice to contain the submenu
          elements.  This defaults to document.body (by default all
          popups are created as direct children of the BODY tag).  The
          only reason why you would want to overwrite this is when you
          have inline HTML containing form fields, so you'll normally
          want them to appear inside some FORM element.  This feature
          is experimental.  You will have problems if the container
          element that you supply has for instance the style
          "position: relative", or if any of its parents have
          "position: relative".
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to pass something here, you need to retrieve a
            reference to the element in the DOM tree.  For example:
          </p>
          <pre>DynarchMenu.setup("menu", { container: document.getElementById("form1") });</pre>
          <p>
            and assign id="form1" to your FORM element.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>clone</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            (boolean) default: false.  For performance reasons,
            DynarchMenu doesn't clone the contents of the elements
            used to initialize the menu—instead it just reuses the
            same DOM nodes.  This means that if you assign an ID to
            some IMG element used as an icon, for instance, you will
            later be able to change that icon by looking the element
            up with document.getElementById.  On the downside though,
            if you want to clone a submenu in multiple menus, icons
            and HTML-based popups will onlt display correctly in the
            first instantiation.  If that's the case you need to pass
            "clone: true" to all DynarchMenu.setup calls.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>onPopup</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            (function).  This function handler will be called each
            time a submenu or a context menu is displayed.  Example:
          </p>
          <pre><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="function-name">onPopup</span>(target, item, pos) {
  alert(<span class="keyword">this</span>.id); <span class="comment">// the ID of the submenu, as assigned to &lt;ul&gt;
</span>  alert(item.label); <span class="comment">// label of the parent item
</span>  alert(pos.x + <span class="string">&quot;,&quot;</span> + pos.y); <span class="comment">// requested position of the submenu
</span>}</pre>
          <p>
            This handler allows you to modify the submenu right before
            it is displayed, for instance to hide/show certain items,
            or disable/enable, etc.  See <a target="_blank"
            href="examples/context4.html">an example here</a>.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>frames</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            (object).  You can use this parameter to tell DynarchMenu
            to use 2 frames for the menus.  You must pass 2
            properties: the name of the “main” frame (where the main
            menu will appear), and the name of the “popups” frame,
            where the popup menus will appear.
          </p>
<pre>  DynarchMenu.setup(<span class="string">&quot;menu&quot;</span>, {
    frames: {
      main: <span class="string">&quot;top_frame&quot;</span>,
      popups: <span class="string">&quot;bottom_frame&quot;</span>
    },
    clone: <span class="keyword">true</span>
  });</pre>
          <p>
            As you can see in the above example, we're passing to
            DynarchMenu.setup the names of the two frames.  Then,
            DynarchMenu will magically know to lookup the "menu" ul in
            the "top_frame" frame, and will create the menu in such a
            way that popups will display in "bottom_frame".
          </p>
          <p>
            An important note is that we need to pass "clone: true",
            because in cross-frame mode the menu must not destroy the
            original elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please <a target="_blank" href="examples/framesv.html">see
            the frames sample</a> for more information.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>“<tt>scrolling</tt>”</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            (boolean or object).  When you have really long menus and
            you want they to fit on the screen with scroll arrows, you
            can pass here <tt>true</tt> or an object of the following
            form:
          </p>
<pre>{
  step1: 5,
  step2: 10,
  speed: 30
}</pre>
          <p>
            The above are the default values that are used when you
            pass "true".  "step1" is the scrolling step in pixels when
            the mouse hovers a scroll arrow, "step2" is the step in
            pixels when the scroll arrow is pressed and "speed" is the
            timeout in milliseconds between consecutive scroll
            updates.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Examples</h3>

      <p>
        Setting a menu that opens submenus on “mouseover” and
        instantly closes them on “mouseout”:
      </p>

      <pre>DynarchMenu.setup("menu", { electric: true });</pre>

      <hr />

      <p>
        Setting a menu that opens submenus on “mouseover” and closes
        them after 250 milliseconds on “mouseout”; additionally, this
        one displays tooltips.
      </p>

      <pre>DynarchMenu.setup("menu", { electric: 250, tooltips: true });</pre>
