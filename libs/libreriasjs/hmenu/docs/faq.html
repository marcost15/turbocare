  <p class="q" id="q1">While the page is loading, I can see the UL contents.  Is this supposed to happen? (<a href="#toc">^^ toc ^^</a>)</p>

  <div class="a">
    <p>
      Yes and no.  We don't want it to happen, but it happens because
      the menu is defined in plain HTML.  However, there are simple
      solutions to avoid the problem.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Give the UL the style “display: none”</em>.  This is the
          simplest workaround and you can apply it by defining the
          toplevel UL element like this:
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;<span class="function-name">ul</span> id=<span class="string">&quot;menu&quot;</span> style=<span class="string">&quot;display: none&quot;</span>&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Expectedly, it will hide the UL element; this will have no
          effect on the menu itself, which means that the menu will
          appear OK after the page finished loading, when
          DynarchMenu.setup is called.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an important drawback: browsers that support CSS
          and don't support JavaScript--perhaps because it was
          disabled by end-user--will fail to display the UL, because
          it was hidden.  The next solution deals with it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Set “display: none” from JavaScript</em>.  As you can
          imagine, this will overcome the drawback of (1), because if
          a browser supports JavaScript chances are that it will
          support DynarchMenu, so it's good to hide the UL.  Here's
          how we can do that:
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;<span class="function-name">script</span> type=<span class="string">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span>&gt;//&lt;![CDATA[
  document.writeln(<span class="string">&quot;&lt;style type='text/css'&gt;#menu { display: none; }&lt;/style&gt;&quot;</span>);
//]]&gt;&lt;<span class="function-name">/script</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="function-name">ul</span> id=<span class="string">&quot;menu&quot;</span>&gt;
  ... menu contents here ...
&lt;<span class="function-name">/ul</span>&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Note that it's not very orthodox, because we're writing a
          &lt;style&gt; tag inside the document body.  It would
          probably be better to put the SCRIPT part in the document
          head.  But nevertheless, it does the job and does it well.
          So what it does?  It dynamically writes a small CSS section
          that specifies that the element having the id="menu" (this
          is the “#menu” selector) should not be displayed.  Because
          it's done from JavaScript, it's clear that browsers with no
          JavaScript support <em>will</em> display the UL, which is
          good because the menu won't work anyway.

  <p class="q" id="q2">How can I remove the icon space?  I don't use any icons. (<a href="#toc">^^ toc ^^</a>)</p>
  <div class="a">
    <p>
      If you don't use icons at all, it indeed makes sense to remove
      the icon space and it's very easy.  Just add the following lines
      somewhere in your CSS code, but <em>after</em> loading the
      DynarchMenu skin:
    </p>
    <pre>div<span class="variable-name">.dynarch-popup-menu</span> tr<span class="variable-name">.item</span> td<span class="variable-name">.icon</span> img,
div<span class="variable-name">.dynarch-popup-menu</span> tr<span class="variable-name">.item</span> td<span class="variable-name">.icon</span> div {
  <span class="keyword">width:</span> 0;
}
div<span class="variable-name">.dynarch-popup-menu</span> tr<span class="variable-name">.item</span> td<span class="variable-name">.icon</span> {
  <span class="keyword">width:</span> 0;
}</pre>
    <p>
      If you do this, no icons may appear in any menu.  Sometimes this
      may not be desirable—perhaps you need to include icons in
      certain popups and no icons in others.  So you can instead use
      the following code:
    </p>
<pre>div<span class="variable-name">.noicons</span> tr<span class="variable-name">.item</span> td<span class="variable-name">.icon</span> img,
div<span class="variable-name">.noicons</span> tr<span class="variable-name">.item</span> td<span class="variable-name">.icon</span> div {
  <span class="keyword">width:</span> 0;
}
div<span class="variable-name">.noicons</span> tr<span class="variable-name">.item</span> td<span class="variable-name">.icon</span> {
  <span class="keyword">width:</span> 0;
}</pre>
    <p>
      and add the "noicons" class name to the UL elements that define
      popups where you don't want icons, like this:
    </p>
<pre><span class="function-name">&lt;</span><span class="html-tag">ul</span> <span class="variable-name">class=</span><span class="string">&quot;noicons&quot;</span><span class="function-name">&gt;</span>
  <span class="function-name">&lt;</span><span class="html-tag">li</span><span class="function-name">&gt;</span>Item without icon<span class="function-name">&lt;</span><span class="html-tag">/li</span><span class="function-name">&gt;</span>
  ...
<span class="function-name">&lt;</span><span class="html-tag">/ul</span><span class="function-name">&gt;</span></pre>

  <div class="a">
    <p>
      We considered the possibility of really big menus and we added a
      configuration parameter that helps a lot.  Check our <a
      onclick="showSection('config'); return false;" href="config.html">page
      about customization</a> and look for the “lazy” parameter.  In
      short, it features a technique called “lazy initialization”
      which allows the menu to appear <em>instantly</em>, no matter
      how many items does it have.
    </p>
  </div>
</li>

<li>
  <p class="q" id="q5">How can I change fonts in menu items? (<a href="#toc">^^ toc ^^</a>)</p>

  <div class="a">
    <h5>» Theory</h5>

    <p>
      The fonts in DynarchMenu, like the colors and backgrounds, are
      completely customizable through CSS.  As described in <a
      onclick="showSection('skins'); return false;" href="skins.html">the Skins
      section</a>, the CSS files are split into 2 types: “layout”
      files, defining only borders, padding, margins and fonts, and
      “look” files, defining colors and backgrounds.  The same layout
      file can be used for multiple skins.  For instance, the Win98,
      Win2k, Modern and System skins, all use “hmenu-3d.css”.  Since
      the fonts are the same in all these skins, it made sense to only
      define them in the layout file.
    </p>

    <p>
      But wait, “hmenu-3d.css” doesn't define any fonts.  That's
      because it includes the more generic “hmenu.css” (this is the
      basic layout file, included directly or indirectly by all
      skins).  In “hmenu.css” we can see the following CSS rule
      (indented here for clarity):
    </p>

    <pre>div<span class="variable-name">.dynarch-horiz-menu</span> table, div<span class="variable-name">.dynarch-popup-menu</span> table
{
   <span class="keyword">font:</span> 11px tahoma,verdana,sans-serif;
}</pre>

    <p>
      Modifying the above line will change fonts in (almost) all
      skins.  Why “almost”?  Because skins can override it; for
      instance, we are using this in our Aqua skin in order to provide
      a font that more accurately resembles the wonderful Mac fonts:
    </p>

    <pre>div<span class="variable-name">.dynarch-horiz-menu</span> table, div<span class="variable-name">.dynarch-popup-menu</span> table
{
   <span class="keyword">font-family:</span> <span class="string">&quot;Lucida Grande&quot;</span>,<span class="string">&quot;trebuchet ms&quot;</span>,verdana,sans-serif;
}</pre>

    <p>
      The above lines only override the font family, keeping the same
      size as defined in “hmenu.css” (11px).  This works because
      “hmenu.css” is imported before the above CSS rule.
    </p>

    <h5>» Practice</h5>

    <p>
      So if you want to modify fonts, it turns out you have several
      options:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Change hmenu.css or skin files directly.</em> This seems
      to be the easiest, but has the disadvantage that you need to
      backup the file if you upgrade your DynarchMenu installation.</li>
      <li><em>Write a different file that customizes your favorite
      skin.</em> We recommed this because you don't change DynarchMenu
      files directly.  Instead you only create a new file which
      imports the DynarchMenu skin and adds additional rules to match
      your taste.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Here's an example of how you could implement #2, assuming that
      your DynarchMenu installation is located in "/hmenu/".  You hate
      the fonts in Aqua so you thought you should “fix” them:
    </p>

    <pre><span class="keyword">@import</span> url(<span class="string">&quot;/hmenu/skin-aqua.css&quot;</span>);

div<span class="variable-name">.dynarch-horiz-menu</span> table, div<span class="variable-name">.dynarch-popup-menu</span> table
{
   <span class="keyword">font:</span> 20px Arial,sans-serif;
}</pre>

    <p>
      Save the above file in, say, "/my-dynarch-menu-skin.css", and in
      your HTML pages, instead of loading "/hemu/skin-aqua.css" just
      load "/my-dynarch-menu-skin.css".  As you can see, at the
      beginning of the CSS file we import the DynarchMenu skin, which
      in turn imports the right layout files, so you only need to load
      one CSS file.  The above “skin” is based on Aqua and looks like
      it with the difference that it has some really big fonts.
    </p>
  </div>
</li>

<li id="iecache">
  <p class="q" id="q6">Can I avoid flickering in IE with the Aqua/Rain skin? (<a href="#toc">^^ toc ^^</a>)</p>

  <div class="a">
    <p>
      Fortunately, yes (I can say this after spending literally days
      of investigation).  IE has a broken cache.  Images linked from
      CSS are requested from server <em>each time they are
      displayed</em>.  A thorough analysis can be found <a
      href="http://www.bazon.net/mishoo/articles.epl?art_id=958"
      title="IE: popularity theft (opens new window)"
      target="_blank">on my website</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the solution is to preload all images that are linked
      from DynarchMenu CSS files.  To make things easier, DynarchMenu
      includes some plain text files that list all the images included
      by every skin; using these files you can easily write a
      server-side script that preloads them.  Here's for instance how
      “<tt>I-skin-aqua.css.images</tt>” looks like:
    </p>
    <pre>img/aqua/rarrow-hover.gif
img/aqua/normal-bg.png
img/aqua/active-bg.png
img/blank.gif
img/aqua/rarrow.gif
img/shadow.png
img/rarrow-hover.gif
img/rarrow.gif
img/aqua/hover-bg.png
img/aqua/right-bg.png
img/aqua/left-bg.png</pre>
    <p>
      (the “I-*.images” files are in the “src/” subdirectory from your
      DynarchMenu distribution, and are named by a simple rule:
      “I-skin-name.css.images”, where “skin-name” is the name of the
      CSS file, without the “.css” extension.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The “I-*.images” files list all images that should be preloaded
      by the page in order for it to work properly with Internet
      Explorer.  Preloading the images simply means writing the
      following code somewhere in your page:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;<span class="function-name">div</span> style=<span class="string">&quot;display: none&quot;</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="function-name">img</span> src=<span class="string">&quot;/hmenu/img/aqua/normal-bg.png&quot;</span> alt=<span class="string">&quot;&quot;</span> /&gt;
  &lt;<span class="function-name">img</span> src=<span class="string">&quot;/hmenu/img/aqua/active-bg.png&quot;</span> alt=<span class="string">&quot;&quot;</span> /&gt;
  [ ... ]
&lt;<span class="function-name">/div</span>&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      The above can be done easily with any server-side scripting
      language, or even manually (but I personally think that
      automating things is the way computers should be used).  Just
      prepend to any image listed in the “I-*” file the path to
      your DynarchMenu installation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Please note that <a
      href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;319546"
      target="_blank" title="About this bug at Microsoft.com (opens new window)"
      >Microsoft itself recommends preloading</a>.</b> As

      you can see at the Microsoft website, this bug only happens in
      IE&nbsp;5.5 or later (it wasn't there in 5.0) and it is not a
      bug but, instead, it's something done “by design” (this means
      “intentional”, right?) by the IE team.  Microsoft will not fix
      the cache bug; the cache bug does not exist.  Instead, you are
      expected to fix your stuff, and the recommended way is
      preloading the images.  Thank you Microsoft for making things so
      much easier for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>UPDATE 2.7:</strong> — Starting with version 2.7,
      DynarchMenu includes a function that makes image preloading much
      easier.  You just need to include the following code just before
      closing the &lt;/body&gt; tag:
    </p>

    <pre>  <strong><span class="function-name">&lt;</span><span class="html-tag">script</span> <span class="variable-name">type=</span><span class="string">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class="function-name">&gt;</span>
    DynarchMenu.preloadImages<span class="function-name">(</span>new RegExp<span class="function-name">(</span><span class="string">&quot;^/hmenu/&quot;</span><span class="function-name">))</span>;
  <span class="function-name">&lt;</span><span class="html-tag">/script</span><span class="function-name">&gt;</span></strong>
<span class="function-name">&lt;</span><span class="html-tag">/body</span><span class="function-name">&gt;</span></pre>

    <p>
      The above assumes that your DynarchMenu is installed in
      "/hmenu/", and it will preload all images that are defined in
      any CSS files loaded from that location.
