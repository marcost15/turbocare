    <p>
      Sometimes, the HTML inside a popup menu can get quite
      complicated.  In this case, it's desirable that it doesn't
      behave like a menu item anymore, that is: it shouldn't get
      “hover” or “active” states, it should be skipped by keyboard
      navigation keys such as “up arrow” and “down arrow”, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page demonstrates how you can embed really complicated
      stuff into a menu.  It's a normal menu which has some normal
      menu items&mdash;they will behave as usual.  And inside it there
      is a piece of HTML code which contains a form with a nested
      table, labels, input fields, submit buttons, paragraphs, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way to do this is to embed the HTML in a DIV.  Therefore,
      you have:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The &lt;LI&gt; element, which defines the start of a menu
        item.  This is required and has still to be present, even for
        such complicated HTML.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inside the &lt;LI&gt; you directly put a &lt;DIV&gt; element.
        When DynarchMenu sees a DIV element, it will ignore all the
        rest and make this item an “html popup” item.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can put whatever you want in the DIV element.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Do not try to include a submenu to an html item.  It will not
      work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another thing to consider is that, this demo shows that you can
      combine normal menu items with full HTML menu items.  But you're
      in no way required to do that&mdash;you can of course have a
      submenu which is entirely formed out of one (or more) HTML
      items.  We don't like restrictions ;-)
