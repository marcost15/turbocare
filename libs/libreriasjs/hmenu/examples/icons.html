      The code in this page shows you various ways you can use to
      include icons in menu items.  Again, remember, since our menu is
      defined as plain HTML code, then you'd need no extra JS
      knowledge in order to include an icon&mdash;you just need to
      know how to use the IMG tag, which you do, right? ;-)
    </p>

    <ul id="menu">
      <li>
        <a href="http://dynarch.com"
           title="Open dynarch.com website (in a new window)"
           target="_blank">
          <img src="../icons/dynarch-14.png" alt="" />
        </a>
      </li>
      <li></li>
      <li>
        <img src="../icons/magnifier.gif" alt="" />
        _File
        <ul>
          <li>
            <img src="../icons/save.gif" alt="" />
            <a href="javascript:alert('We do not save anything; this is just an example.')">
              _Save
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      So, if you look through the page source, the golden rule to
      follow is simple: just include an &lt;IMG&gt; tag that displays
      the icon, as you would in ordinary HTML.  For horizontal menu
      items (top-level) put this link into the &lt;A&gt; tag.  For the
      vertical menus items, make sure the &lt;IMG&gt; tag is outside
      the link&mdash;we are using this in order to provide proper
      alignment of menu icons.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can safely include PNG icons with variable transparency, as
      long as you also put this line at the end of your document,
      before the end of the &lt;body&gt; tag:
    </p>

    <pre>&lt;script type=<span class="string">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span> src=<span class="string">&quot;/path/to/hmenu/src/PieNG.js&quot;</span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      So, the idea is to have this script loaded as the last thing in
      page; it will take care of patching all IMG tags to work
      properly with Internet Explorer 5.5 or later (no need for such
      patches for browsers such as Mozilla, Opera, Safari, Konqueror,
      and maybe others, as they can display PNG-s correctly
      out-of-the-box; as usual, from all lot, only IE needs special
      treatment).
    </p>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="../src/PieNG.js"></script>
