      <h1>Questions and answers</h1>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p class="q">
            How did you make it disable the item for the current page?
          </p>
          <p>
            Pretty easy.  We defined an ID for all menu items, so that
            they can be accessed thereafter using "menu.items[ID]".
            Then, each page defines a global variable MENU_ITEM, which
            can be accessed from the toplevel frameset using
            "window.frames.popups_frame.MENU_ITEM".  Then, after
            retrieving the item, we simply call item.disable().
            Something like this:
          </p>
          <pre>menu.items["item-" + window.frames.popups_frame.MENU_ITEM].disable();</pre>
          <p>
            Check the sources to see the exact code.

        <li>
          <p class="q">
            What browsers has this been tested on?
          </p>
          <p>
            We tested and found to work Mozilla/Firefox (any
            platform), Internet Explorer 6 for Windows, Opera 8 (any
            platform), Apple Safari (Macintosh) and Konqueror (Linux).
          </p>
          <p>
            Also tested with IE7 Beta, works flawless.

        <li>
          <p class="q">
            Does the “lazy” setting work with cross-frame menus?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, but you won't be able to disable items as described in (1).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="q">
            Does keyboard navigation work?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, with the same restrictions as in non frame-based
            setups: only with IE and Mozilla/Firefox.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="q">
            Why are those "init" and "reinit" functions needed?<br />
            They seem to do quite the same thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            These functions are not doing the same thing.  The idea is
            that "init()" is called once when <em>all</em> the frames
            have loaded.  And it sets up the menu for the first time.
            It is a requirement to make sure that all frames are
            loaded, before setting up the menu—hence, this function is
            called from the <em>frameset</em>'s "onload" event.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right around that moment, the "reinit()" is called too,
            because the second frame has finished loading—but we don't
            know for sure that <em>all</em> frames have loaded, so we
            can't simply construct the menu there.  Therefore, we
            ignore the first call, using the "first_time" global
            (which gets set to "false" this time).
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, when the content of the "popups_frame" has changed,
            we need to reinitialize the menu (for reasons described in
            the <a href="details.html">technical notes</a>).  This is
            now safely accomplished in the "reinit()" function, which
            "knows" that the menu was instantiated once by examining
            the "first_call" global: if it's "false", then call
            "init()". ;-)
          </p>
          <p>
            We find this model quite simple to understand and
            implement.
